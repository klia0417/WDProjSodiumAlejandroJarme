    <p>TWICE was formed by JYP Entertainment in 2015 through the survival show SIXTEEN. Their debut song “Like Ooh-Ahh” marked the beginning of what would become one of the most successful girl group careers in K-pop.</p>

    <p>With chart-topping albums, sold-out tours, and hit songs such as “Cheer Up,” “TT,” “Fancy,” and “I Can’t Stop Me,” the group continues to break barriers. Today, TWICE remains a cultural icon known for unity, versatility, and artistic growth.</p>
