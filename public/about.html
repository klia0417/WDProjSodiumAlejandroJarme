        TWICE was formed by JYP Entertainment in 2015 through the survival show SIXTEEN. Their debut song 
        “Like Ooh-Ahh” marked the beginning of what would become one of the most successful girl group careers in K-pop.

        With chart-topping albums, sold-out tours, and hit songs such as “Cheer Up,” “TT,” “Fancy,” and 
        “I Can’t Stop Me,” the group continues to break barriers. Today, TWICE remains a cultural icon 
        known for unity, versatility, and artistic growth.
